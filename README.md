# Theseus is an ~~cool~~ **unsurpassed** Autothesaurus.

## ~~Usage~~ **Operation**

Enter your text on the box to the left, see synonyms for the words in the text in the box to the right.

## Installation

Theseus is an ~~simple~~ **unornamented** web application using FastAPI as its backend. A Python 3.10.0 virtual environment is recommended. To install all of the ~~necessary~~ **compulsory** dependencies, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It is also necessary to have an API key from [Merriam Webster](https://dictionaryapi.com/). This key should go in `.env` like `DICTIONARY_API_KEY=********-****-****-****-************`. Without this the application will not be ~~able~~ **qualified** to ask their API for synonyms. Once this is set up, run `uvicorn main:app` to ~~run~~ **activate** the application. You can specify a host and a port with the `--host` and `--port` parameters.
